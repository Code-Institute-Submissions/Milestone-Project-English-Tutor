# Title:
# Jeanette Buckley - English Laguage Tutor


## Introduction:
Since moving to France my wife has studied and become an English Language tutor. 
She has been employed for the last five years by the Chambre de Commerce 
and has now also started to work as an autoentrepreneur. Up until now she has relied on word of mouth for new clients but she is looking to expand.

The idea for this project was to advertise her work to a wider audience. I hope to highlight all the different options displaying course choices, levels offered, 
useful links and reviews from past and present students. This will hopefully achieve higher student takeup.


## UX
The website is designed for students looking to gain additional language skills by hiring Ms Buckley as a tutor and supplying useful links to education material.
The user can navigate through the website and easily pull out the information they need and how to contact Ms Buckley.


## Features:
Below are the sections which are incorporated into the website.

'About Me'- gives you background on who Ms Buckley is, her education and who she teaches.

'Classes/Prices' - gives an overview of the classes she will teach and the relevent prices.

'Reviews' - shows comments provided by past and present students and the idea is that recommendations for other people says alot.

'References' -  has useful links to podcasts, blog, videos and other useful websites. These are also good sources for learning.

'Contact' - information form to provide name, email, class type you are interested in, current language level and text area for additional information.

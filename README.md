# Title:
# Jeanette Buckley - English Laguage Tutor


## Introduction:
Since moving to France my wife has studied and become an English Language tutor. 
She has been employed for the last five years by the Chambre de Commerce 
and has now also started to work as an autoentrepreneur. Up until now she has relied on word of mouth for new clients but she is looking to expand.

The idea for this project was to advertise her work to a wider audience. I hope to highlight all the different options displaying course choices, levels offered, 
useful links and reviews from past and present students. This will hopefully achieve higher student takeup.


## UX
The website is designed for students looking to gain additional language skills by hiring Ms Buckley as a tutor and supplying useful links to education material.
The user can navigate through the website in either french or english and easily pull out the information they need and how to contact Ms Buckley.


## Features:
Below are the sections which are incorporated into the website.

'Flags' - allow the user to change the language of the website.

'About Me'- gives you background on who Ms Buckley is, her education and who she teaches.

'Classes/Prices' - gives an overview of the classes she will teach and the relevent prices.

'Reviews' - shows comments provided by past and present students and the idea is that recommendations for other people says alot. 
Background images represent the type of people she has taught. These are business people, colleague student, retired people looking to travel and people who like to learning
new languages for pleasure.

'References' -  has useful links to podcasts, blog, videos and other useful websites. These are also good sources for learning.

'Contact' - information form to provide name, email, class type you are interested in, current language level and text area for additional information.

Review text checked on multiple devices and inspection tool to see best break point for change in font size.

### Links -
Checked that all links access the correct site and are displayed in a new tab. Problem found on Microsoft edge where alignment of boxes did not work.
On large screen should display two rows of two but instead displayed one column of four and was off center. Code changed and display is correct.

### Social links -
Social links currently go to log in page as J Buckley needs to create the accounts.

Required fields are first name, last name and email.
For first and last name message appears when fields are blank.

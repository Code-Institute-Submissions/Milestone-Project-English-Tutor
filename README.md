# Title:
# Jeanette Buckley - English Laguage Tutor


## Introduction:
Since moving to France my wife has studied and become an English Language tutor. 
She has been employed for the last five years by the Chambre de Commerce 
and has now also started to work as an autoentrepreneur. Up until now she has relied on word of mouth for new clients but she is looking to expand.

The idea for this project was to advertise her work to a wider audience. I hope to highlight all the different options displaying course choices, levels offered, 
useful links and reviews from past and present students. This will hopefully achieve higher student takeup.


## UX
The website is designed for students looking to gain additional language skills by hiring Ms Buckley as a tutor and supplying useful links to education material.
The user can navigate through the website and easily pull out the information they need and how to contact Ms Buckley.


## Features:
Below are the sections which are incorporated into the website.

'About Me'- gives you background on who Ms Buckley is, her education and who she teaches.

'Classes/Prices' - gives an overview of the classes she will teach and the relevent prices.

'Reviews' - shows comments provided by past and present students and the idea is that recommendations for other people says alot. 
Background images represent the type of people she has taught. These are business people, colleague student, retired people looking to travel and people who like to learning
new languages for pleasure.

'References' -  has useful links to podcasts, blog, videos and other useful websites. These are also good sources for learning.

'Contact' - information form to provide name, email, class type you are interested in, current language level and text area for additional information.

## Testing:

Tested through the inspection tools in responsive mode and various screen sizes on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge.
As mentioned below in Microsoft Edge there seems to be an aligment issue in the reference section.

### Navbar -
Moved through page in sequental order.
Moved through page in random order

### Reviews -
Review text checked on multiple devices and inspection tool to see best break point for change in font size.

### References -
Checked that all links links access the correct site and are displayed in a new tab.

### Contact form -
Required fields are first name, last name and email.
For first and last name message appears when fields are blank.
For email address message appears if blank and also if not valid email address.
On pressing submit button the 'welcome to mail' box will appear to add an account. Found php code to implement full emailing but did not include as not part of project.
